# My lab setup consists of running Anisible on a Ubuntu VM created with Vagrant and running
within Virtual box on my desktop. I am running Ubuntu version 14.04.5. For now, I have 1 physical Juniper
EX2200 setup that I can access. I have already confirmed that I can run simple ad-hoc ansible commands to connect
to it. I will be using the default access method (ssh key-based authentication). The switch is in a managment network
that is accessible by my desktop. I also have ansible running on a operational VM in our vSphere 6.0 cluster. This VM
already has access to the majority of our core routers/switches in our network. I will also be making various changes
to this network as I learn.
